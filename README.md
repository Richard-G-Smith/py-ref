For those wishing to learn Python, I recommend Learn Python the Hard Way. As a word of caution, this book uses Python 2. There are differences between Python 2 and Python 3, and those will need to be addressed. I'm currently looking for a Python 3 guide that is as good as Learn Python the Hard Way.
