py-ref
======

py-ref is a reference sheet for Python 3.
It is targted at beginner programmers new to python.
Many things in Python are easily forgotten or overlooked when first learning the language.
py-ref provides working examples of commonly used syntax and general principals.

The .py file is seperated into broad categories for easy reference.
The .py file can also be ran to show the output of the references.


    py-ref is not a tutorial or learning guide.
    It is intened to be a suplimental learning tool.


I am actively expanding py-ref with additional information.
